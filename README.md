# μOrCS

This is a veeeeeeeery minimalistic version of OrCS[1], the ORdinary Computer
Simulator, which is based on SiNUCA[2].

Professor Marco Zanata, PhD, removed this code from the original OrCS source and
I (Gabriel G. de Brito) took the freedom to refactor it a little bit and call it
"μOrCS" (i.e., "Micro OrCS").

There's some code and some declarations here that appear kinda weird. This is
normal as they were removed from a much bigger codebase, where they made actual
sense.

Happy coding! ;)

## Notice

You may notice that much of this code does not follows the code conventions,
which is really bad. There are plenty of historical reasons to that, but when
refactoring I was not much strict with that, otherwise I would have to rewrite
it all.
